## Description

```md
From my point of view, this project is giving the first step to use javaScriptlas and make the web pages dynamic.
Being able to make changes in the pages designed with HTML and CSS through a programming language is really motivating.
Moreover, incorporating in this project the memory that the browser stores with the details of all the elements of the page,
 and with the data that can be stored temporarily, increases the potential of the tools that we are using. 

I developed this project to:
    - Continue practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    - Understand and test the use of the DOM (document object model).
    - Go deeper into the handling of the browser's temporary memory (localStorage).
     - Even though I did not use it in this challenge,
      I understood how the GET and POST modes work for sending data using a FORM.

The challenge is to build a two-page website to provide the functionality of a simple blog.
On the blog page you can switch between light and dark modes.

During the development of the project, several things were clarified:
    - That the localstorage can be accessed from different instances, in this case the two project pages.
    - That value NULL is diferent of '' 

During this project I learned:
    - What it is and how it works the DOM (document object model)
    - How I can follow the flow of the program since de CONSOLE of Dev Tools of Chrome.
    - How to address de elements of the HTML page from javaScript program.
    - How to change the atributes of an HTML element from de javaScript program.
    - And a very important thing, the powerful of the dev tools CONSOLE as a debugger.
